# COMS 2132 - Intemediate Computing in Python

COMS W2132 (Intermediate Computing in Python) is an interdisciplinary course in computing for non-CS majors. The course combines essential data structures and algorithms in Python with practical software development skills. This is a follow-up course to COMS W1002 (Computing in Context) or ENGI E1006 (Introduction to Computing for Engineers and Applied Scientists). The course serves as an alternative to the second-semester data structures class (COMS W3134, currently taught in Java) so that non-CS-majors, who may only take two CS courses, can take this as a terminal second CS course. However, the course may also prepares students for more advanced coursework in Computer Science.
