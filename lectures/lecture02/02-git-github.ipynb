    "This course will use Git and [GitHub](https://github.com/) to manage all assignments and the project. If you have used GitHub and the `git` command line tool before, this lecture serves a refresher. If you have not used Git in the terminal before, this lecture will cover the basics you need for this course. There are many advanced features we will not cover today -- please refer to the Pro Git book (linked above) for more details. The book is an excellent resource for learning git.\n",

    "Some of you may have interacted with projects on GitHub via its web interface or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as VSCode or Spyder. That's fine, and this approach works well for simple modifications and common workflows. For more complicated scenarios, e.g., when multiple developers closely collaborate on a project and generate multiple branches that need merging or conflict resolution, you may need to restore to the command line `git` tool. The command line tool will be the focus of this lecture."
